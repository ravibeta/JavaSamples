This app draws a piechart of the web pages visited from your phone. Get a breakdown of the last 24 hours of web activity to better manage your time.

MyTimeChart:
You use your phone to read web pages. Even the pages opened by applications with or without your knowledge are logged and categorized to draw a piechart of your activity.
Track the usages with this app. Get back your productivity by limiting your time.

Did you know that you access hundreds of web pages from the applications on your phone including your web browser but you could not tell how much time you spent on them. This application counts all the web pages you have visited, directly or via an application and shows you a tally by group. Use it wisely to limit your time and change your habit for better productivity.

Unlike applications on the play store that may show a breakdown of time spent on applications such as SMS, whatsapp, facebook and other applications, this application uses a proxy to read all the web pages or http requests made by those applications and has access to much more detail than just the name of the application. You probably already knew which applications you used because you open them to use it. What you did not know were the web requests made by those applications indirectly for you or when you used the browser. Those web requests is public information but just not accessible until now. You can even use it to correlate applications that are accessing the web in ways you wouldn't want it to or did not know about it. A lot of programmatic access are made on the web by these applications so you have better insight into the activity originating from your phone.

Use this application measure and control the activities on your phone that are
- unintentional and costing you data and usage
- taking up your phone time and preventing you from focusing on your task
- set yourself a daily goal on the web pages you want to access
- resist from checking your phone and take time to smell the roses.

All this with a simple pie chart and no effort on your part.
